In this module, I will be exploring the full data mining lifecycle, from data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis to the application and evaluation of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms using Python and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. 
The goal is to gain experience at using machine learning and data mining tools and techniques to extract insights from data.
